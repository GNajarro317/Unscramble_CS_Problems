### Project Title
Unscramble Computer Science Problems

### Description
In this project, I completed five tasks using a fabricated dataset of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. I utilized Python to analyze the data and answer questions regarding the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Additionally, I performed a runtime analysis of my solutions to determine their efficiency.

The project involved:

* Analyzing data from calls and texts to extract insights.
* Breaking down problems into inputs and outputs for effective coding.
* Conducting an efficiency analysis of the solutions.
* Reinforcing my Python skills in a practical scenario.

### Files used:
Text data (texts.csv) with columns for sending and receiving telephone numbers and the timestamp of each text.
Call data (calls.csv) with columns for calling and receiving telephone numbers, the start timestamp of the call, and the call duration in seconds.

The dataset includes:
Telephone Number Formats

The dataset includes three types of telephone numbers:
Fixed Lines: Start with an area code in brackets, e.g., "(022)40840621".
Mobile Numbers: Have a space in the middle and start with 7, 8, or 9, e.g., "93412 66159".
Telemarketers' Numbers: Start with the code 140, e.g., "1402316533".

###  Requirements
Python (version 3.12.1)
